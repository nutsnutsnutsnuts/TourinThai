# My senior project TourinThai 
A web application for recommending tourist attractions to international visitors, built using EJS, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.

# Introduction
With the rapid growth of Thailand's tourism industry, there are many hidden gems in the Northeastern region that remain undiscovered by international travelers. One key factor influencing tourists' choices is the reviews left by previous visitors, which reflect their experiences and emotions. To assist international tourists in exploring lesser-known destinations, we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis through a Machine Learning-powered web application. This tool analyzes traveler reviews to provide clear emotional insights, helping tourists make informed decisions about their journeys.

# Objectives
1. To develop a web application that introduces and promotes tourist attractions in Northeastern Thailand to
international visitors.
2. To implement a system capable of analyzing sentiment from tourist reviews, offering personalized recommendations.
3. To support international tourists in making travel decisions based on genuine experiences and emotional insights from previous visitors.
4. To streamline access to comprehensive tourist reviews and information.
5. To explore and apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies for enhanced data analysis.
